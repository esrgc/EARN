                If you are already a member of an EARN Maryland partnership, it may not be reflected 
                here because a Partnership Profile has not yet been created on this site, or because
                the Partnership Profile Administrator has not yet invited or confirmed your membership yet. 
                Once you are a member of a partnership or partnerships within EARN MD CONNECT, they
                will be listed here. 
                As such, if you are already part of a Planning Grant Applicant Group, you will not have
                an Organization or a Partnership Profile on EARN MD CONNECT until one is created!
              </p>
              <p class="text-muted">
                If there is not yet a Partnership Profile within EARN MD CONNECT for your partnership, 
                one can be created by clicking “Create new partnership” above. 
                Please note that <u>the user who creates the Partnership Profile will become the Partnership 
                Profile’s Administrator</u>, and will be the only user able 1) to control the Partnership
                Profile’s membership, 2) to invite other organizations to join your Partnership Profile, 3) to decide whether
                to approve users who request to join your Partnership Profile, and 4) to control the Partnership Profile’s
                Title and Description visible to other EARN MD CONNECT users. As such, partnerships should determine the appropriate
                member to create, and be the Administrator of, their group’s Partnership Profile on EARN MD CONNECT.

              <p class="text-muted">
                You may also <strong>designate additional Administrators</strong> of your Partnership Profile. 
                 To do so, click on the “Partners” tab on the bottom left of your Partnership Profile detail page.
                Select the desired Partner Organization, and click the “Make Admin” button to assign Administrator Privileges.
                <strong>You may also remove your organization as an Administrator</strong> if there exists one or more
                other Administrators. To do so, simply click the “Remove Admin” button next to your own Organization’s profile within the
                “Partners” tab of your Partnership Profile page.
